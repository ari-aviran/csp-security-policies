  name: Ensure all S3 buckets employ encryption-at-rest
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 2
  description: |
    At the Amazon S3 bucket level, you can configure permissions through a bucket policy
    making the objects accessible only through HTTPS.
  rationale: |
    By default, Amazon S3 allows both HTTP and HTTPS requests. To achieve only
    allowing access to Amazon S3 objects through HTTPS you also have to explicitly deny
    access to HTTP requests. Bucket policies that allow HTTPS requests without explicitly
    denying HTTP requests will not comply with this recommendation.
  audit: |
    To allow access to HTTPS you can use a condition that checks for the key
    `"aws:SecureTransport: true"`. This means that the request is sent through HTTPS but
    that HTTP can still be used. So to make sure you do not allow HTTP access confirm
    that there is a bucket policy that explicitly denies access for HTTP requests and that it
    contains the key "aws:SecureTransport": "false".
    **From Console:**
    1. Login to AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console using
    https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/
    2. Select the Check box next to the Bucket.
    3. Click on 'Permissions', then Click on Bucket Policy.
    4. Ensure that a policy is listed that matches:
    ```
    '{
      "Sid": <optional>,
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket_name>/*",
      "Condition": {
      "Bool": {
      "aws:SecureTransport": "false"
    }'
    ```
    `<optional>` and `<bucket_name>` will be specific to your account
    5. Repeat for all the buckets in your AWS account.

    From Console:
    1. Login to AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console using https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/
    2. Select the Check box next to the Bucket.
    3. Click on 'Permissions'.
    4. Click 'Bucket Policy'
    5. Add this to the existing policy filling in the required information
    ```
    {
      "Sid": <optional>",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket_name>/*",
      "Condition": {
        "Bool": {
          "aws:SecureTransport": "false"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    6. Save
    7. Repeat for all the buckets in your AWS account that contain sensitive data.
